Choose a starting date and number of days to consider and this Shortcut will assemble a list of available times in your calendar. That is, the times not already occupied by events or meetings. It ignores all-day events and I have it combine my personal and work calendars when doing the review. Also, you have the option to add travel time around events that have a designated location.
