# iOS Shortcuts
A collection of Shortcuts I routinely use. Note that to make use of the links to add a Shortcut to your own library you need to open that link on an iOS device.

Choose a starting date and number of days to consider and this Shortcut will assemble a list of available times in your calendar. That is, the times not already occupied by events or meetings. It ignores all-day events and I have it combine my personal and work calendars when doing the review. Also, you have the option to add travel time around events that have a designated location. The output is provided three ways:
1. Quickview display
2. Added to a new Draft (Drafts app: [Mac version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248?mt=12), [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471))
3. Copied to the clipboard
